# About DandJourney

DandJourney is an agent robot that encapsulates and expands Midjourney.This robot is mainly used to forward the user's demands to Midjourney (located on the Discord platform). Through the agent of the robot, the user's robot use needs are balanced, and the robot expansion is tried on different platforms.

- More platform support(under development)
- More custom features
- More expansion space.

### Why not usestable-diffusion

Although stable-diffusion is free, its neural network training is very resource-intensive, which can impact the overall output quality and efficiency due to its effect on computer performance and database. Until a better algorithm is developed, using MidJourney for now is also a good choice.

### Project progress

In the absence of a better platform, this project will continue to be updated.

The project is open source, the Bot is only made for the convenience of daily use. Non-project team members are not allowed to use the project for **profit** or **attract people's 'attention'**. 

**Statement**: This robot is for learning use only

# Project iteration

Maybe you came here from [MidJourney-Wrapper（YuexdangRefactored](https://github.com/yuexdang/MidJourney-Wrapper). I would like to clarify the relationship between these two projects again.

This refactoring is quite different from the original author's code. It was built using the `discord-py-interactions` framework and the crawler part was also modified. The overall code has been decoupled and we plan to extract the API later. So I don't want to call it a refactoring version or an inherited version anymore, but a new project started from scratch.

Once again, I would like to thank the original author[Wildric-Auric](https://github.com/Wildric-Auric)and the version I first encountered,[MidJourney-Wrapper](https://github.com/Wildric-Auric/MidJourney-Wrapper).The original idea was of great help to me.
